What i changed based on my lecture feedback

When submitting part 1 of the portfolio of evidence i made a mistake of submitting just the sin. file without the actual code in it
This resulted in me losing marks because i missed the resubmission deadline and I did not have any feedback to put in my part 2 so I also lost marks in part 2.
Based on the feedback provided by my lecturer I have created a read me tag that provides enough instructions on how to run my code
I however didnt not have many changes to implement in my part 3 as my part 2 was perfect i just did minor mistakes which i have mentioned above
